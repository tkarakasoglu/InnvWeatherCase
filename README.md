Known issues:
- Sorting problems with Turkish specific characters. That can be fixed by project specific webservices.
- Used one ViewModel, could be used for all fragments. Found it unnecessary for tiny app. (Also Repository)
- Advanced network connection check could be implemented. There can be loading and retry or pull to refresh system.
- FragmentStateAdapter could be optimized. There is some unnecessary calls
